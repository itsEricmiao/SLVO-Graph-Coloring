# SLVO-Graph-Coloring
A project that looks at implementing an algorithm  in multiple ways to solve a graph coloring problem. It starts by creating different conflict graphs which can represent real world problems will be created and saved in files. Then, carious coloring orders will be implemented and analyzed for runtime efficiency and coloring efficiency.
